# OperatingSystems
In MyShell project, I implemented my own shell which is composed of a set of certain commands. The functionalities of these commands are already available within the default shell of your Linux-based OS. However, it is desired to implement a customized shell so that we can easily remember the commands and their corresponding functionalities.
In MultiThreading project, I used 1-5-10 thread for 10 processes and learned the advantages of multithreading.
In FunFairPayment project, I implemented a multi-threaded application for simulating a fun fair payment system, where the customers can make the prepayments of the various rides through the available ticket vending machines. Since the prepayments can be made simultaneously through different ticket vending machine instances, I used mutex locks.
